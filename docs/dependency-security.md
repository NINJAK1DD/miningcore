# Dependency security

Miningcore restores the complete transitive package graph with `NuGetAuditMode=all`. High and critical
findings (`NU1903` and `NU1904`) fail the build. Low and moderate findings (`NU1901` and `NU1902`) remain
visible as warnings so a newly published advisory cannot unexpectedly prevent every local build and
release while it is being assessed.

Run the same audit explicitly with:

```console
dotnet list src/Miningcore.sln package --vulnerable --include-transitive
```

Upgrade or replace an affected dependency whenever possible. If an immediate upgrade is not possible,
record the affected code path, deployment exposure, compensating controls, owner and removal condition
in the pull request or a tracking issue. A narrowly scoped `NuGetAuditSuppress` for the advisory URL may
be used only with that written risk acceptance; do not disable NuGet auditing or globally suppress the
`NU190x` warning family.

## Legacy NBitcoin.Zcash dependency

`NBitcoin.Zcash` 3.0.0 depends on the deprecated `Portable.BouncyCastle` package. Miningcore pins version
1.9.0 as a runtime-only asset so `NBitcoin.Zcash` can resolve `BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll`, while Miningcore
source compiles exclusively against the maintained `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` package.

The upstream maintainer described the 1.9.x line as end-of-life after 2025 and said further maintenance
would be discretionary. NuGet currently reports a clean graph, but that is not proof that the legacy
assembly is patched: some Bouncy Castle advisories are indexed under the `BouncyCastle` and
`BouncyCastle.Cryptography` package IDs rather than `Portable.BouncyCastle`.

This is an explicit compatibility risk acceptance, not a declaration that the legacy package is secure.
The release gate verifies that both assemblies are present and executes the NBitcoin.Zcash BLAKE2b
binding under Miningcore's published dependency manifest. That test detects packaging and type-binding
regressions; it does not remove the security risk of an unsupported cryptography library.

Remove `Portable.BouncyCastle` when `NBitcoin.Zcash` is upgraded, replaced, or changed so it no longer
requires the legacy assembly. Until then, keep the dependency runtime-only and do not use its
`Org.BouncyCastle.*` types from Miningcore source.
